# Security Contacts

The cert-manager maintainers [`maintainers.csv`](/maintainers.csv) are the
people who (should) have access to read security reports made via the
cert-manager vulnerability reporting process.

If you think you've found a security issue in cert-manager, don't reach
out to any of these people individually - follow the details in
SECURITY.md and report your vulnerability via e-mail.
